# Mammogram Image Classifier

The app accepts all the commonly used Image formats from all views of mammogram images to classify based on **BIRADS** classification standards.
The app was developed using **TensorFlow CNN model** that works on a preprocessed image and achieved a **val_accuracy of 85%**  a considerable accuracy in such cases would fill the time gap in such cases.
